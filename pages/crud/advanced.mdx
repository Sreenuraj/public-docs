## Control Visibility

In the API tab, select the operation:

- **Invisible**: By default, when enabling APIs, Radical generates both the service and controller layers. However, in cases where only the service layer is required, utilize the 'invisible' option.

- **Disable**: This operation is not generated in the API.

Select the settings icon displayed near the schema for which the API needs modification.

## Security

If project-level authentication is enabled, authentication can still be controlled at the granular API level.

Use the **`Authenticate Route`** option to modify this behavior.

## Control Path of API

By default, the pluralized name of the schema is used. For example, if the schema name is "Student," the API path would be "students." Users can override this to modify the base path.

**Note**: To control the API-level base path, adjust the settings.
