# Importer

The JSON Importer allows us to create a schema rapidly, avoiding the need to design field by field.

To import a schema via the importer:

1. Go to the schema tab.
2. Click on "Import."
3. Enter a valid JSON.
4. Enter a valid root object name.
5. Click on "Import Entities."

Note:

The JSON Importer cannot differentiate between `String` and `Enum` types; it will be considered as `String` by default.
