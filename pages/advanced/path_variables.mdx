# Path Variables

Path variables are special placeholders in Radical that can be utilized where a base path or URL is required.

Example:
```/api/v1/clients/{clientId}/accounts/{accountId}```

In this example, `clientId` and `accountId` are considered as path variables.

Path variables can be employed in the following contexts:

* Base path in settings
* Path in the API tab at the resource level setting
* Custom API - Request Path
* REST Requests
