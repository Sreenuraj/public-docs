# What is Sync?

Radical.sh allows code to be explored and downloaded. However, the download option becomes challenging to manage when users execute code and need to make subsequent changes in Radical.

## Sync Advantage

Instead of repeatedly downloading the entire project when making changes, Radical.sh provides a solution: **Sync**.

## Sync Limitations

1. Sync is available in Chrome only and uses the file system API to sync changes.
2. **Warning! - Radical.sh always overwrites any local changes** made in this folder. While this might seem like a limitation, it serves a purpose.


## Steps for Using `Sync`

1. Create a folder named `radical` in your preferred location. If you name the folder with the project name itself, for example, `project-name`, the project will be synced directly to that folder without creating an additional subfolder.
2. Once you choose the directory and allow permission, the project will be created under the `radical` folder or the specified project folder.
3. Treat the `radical` or project folder as read-only, as any changes will be reset once the sync is performed again.
4. Navigate to `radical/<project-name>` or the specified project folder, which contains the source code generated by Radical.
5. Execute the following commands to create a local repo:

    ```bash
    git init
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Initial Radical.sh changes"
    ```

6. Now, this repo includes all the changes related to the radical-generated source code and can be used from the actual development folder.
7. Assuming you have the actual source code in the `sourcecode/<project-name>` folder, execute the git pull command to pull the changes from Radical to your branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b radical-changes
    git pull /<path-to-folder>/radical/<project-name> --allow-unrelated-histories --no-ff --no-commit
    ```

   Resolve conflicts if needed. This option allows modifications to the source code by the user and modifications by codegen, resolving conflicts in a known and proven git format.

If you are making further modifications in Radical.sh and use the sync option, steps 5 and 7 need to be performed again to bring the incremental changes to your repo.
