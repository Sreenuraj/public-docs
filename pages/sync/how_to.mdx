# What is Sync ? 

Radical.sh allows code to be explored and downloadable, however download option goes is out of control if user starts executing code and subsequent changes have to be made in radical. 

Sync limitations

1. Sync is available in Chrome only and it uses file system api to sync changes. 
2. **Warning ! - Radical.sh always overwrite any local changes** that are made into this folder. While this sounds like a limitation, but it isn't.

Steps for using `Sync` 
1. Create a folder named `radical` in your preferred location and choose this folder as sync target location. 
2. Once you choose the directory and allow permission, the project will be created under `radical` folder
3. Treat `radical` folder as read only and any changes will be reset once the sync is made again. 
4. Navigate to `radical/<project-name>` and this contains the source code generated by radical
5. Execute following commands to have a local repo

    `git init`

    `git add -A`

    `git commit -m "Initial Radical.sh changes"`

6. Now this repo has all the changes related to radical generated source code and it can be used from actual development folder
7. Assuming you have the actual source code in `sourcecode/<project-name>` folder. You can execute git pull command to pull the changes from radical to your branch

    `git checkout -b radical-changes`

    `git pull /<path-to-folder>/radical/<project-name> --allow-unrelated-histories  --no-ff --no-commit`

Resolve conflicts if needed. This option allows, modifications on to source code by user and modifications by codegen and resolving the conflicts in known and proven format of git.

If you are doing further modifications in radical.sh, and hit sync option, step 5 and 7 to be performed again to bring the incremental changes to your repo.
