### Order Service

Create a new project with name as `Order Service`



1. Add a schema for order and make orderId as key, use import option in schema page and use the json provided here and enter `Order` as root object name
<details>
  <summary>Order Schema</summary>


```json

{
    "orderId": "4265b3e3-4c1e-4f2e-9d32-7d66bb87b9c7",
    "customerId": "76ffd945-e658-4450-9952-6553437507fe",
    "restaurantId":"b15eaf54-5a9c-4b0b-b180-bb0f947cdcf7",
    "customer":{
        "customerId": "8898871c-7ef1-4e19-a07a-5322615f267e",
        "contactNumber": "xxxx"
    },
    "orderlines":[
        {
            "quantity": 2,
            "productId": "8a0ff617-83a2-4a90-8ce7-551070dceb10",
            "instructions" : "reduce salt"
        }
    ],    
}


```

</details>
2. Add auditor fields from schema designer page
3. Enable API for order and have the API's as async
    - Convert create into async action and rename the event as OrderAccepted
    - Convert update into async action
    - Convert delete into async action and rename the event as OrderCancelled
4. Add authentication as JWT per project requirement 

Assumption - Apps / Web App have SSO enabled that can provide JWT token

This enables all API's and all events on Order - No additional manual coding for this requirement.

Order API can be used to take order from customer and updates can be used to update the order cooking completion from chef

### Delivery Service

Create a new project with name as `Delivery Service`

1. Add a schema for delivery with deliveryId as key and add auditor fields after schema import
<details>
  <summary>Delivery Schema</summary>


```json

{
    "orderId": "4265b3e3-4c1e-4f2e-9d32-7d66bb87b9c7",
    "deliveryId": "76ffd945-e658-4450-9952-6553437507fe",
    "status":"CREATED",       
    "assistantId":"8affd945-5658-2450-2992-0553432307fe",
    "customer":{
        "customerId": "8898871c-7ef1-4e19-a07a-5322615f267e",
        "contactNumber": "xxxx"
    },
}


```

</details>
2. Enable API for delivery and have API's as async
3. Disable API for create and the delivery can be created by listened order completion message
4. Add an inbound event which listen to the topic of order service
5. Inbound event should point to the action of create delivery
6. Manual coding is required from event consumer to service invocation that creates delivery

### Notification Service

Create a new project with name as `Notification Service`

1. Add a schema for notification via import schema option with notificationId as key
<details>
  <summary>Notification Schema</summary>


```json

{
    "notificationId": "726c081e-a487-464e-99de-4364700ef686",
    "message": "Your order {orderId} will be delivered soon by our delivery assistant"
}


```

</details>

2. Notification needs to have key fields like notification content, and notification type as SMS or Email
3. Enable API for notification and mark them as invisble so that no API's are exposed and this become event driven microservice
4. Go to integrations tab and add the request for sending sms / email
5. Manual coding will be required in service layer that invokes twillio services, respoitory call can be added / removed as per business requirement.
and in event consumer layer that receives delivery event and invokes create notification


### Twillio Service

Twillio is a third party service

1. You need to sign up and get credentials
2. Notification service will use twillio credentials

Note : radical does not allow storage of credentials in properties or any repository files by design
