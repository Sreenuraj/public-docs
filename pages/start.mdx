# Getting Started

Let's leverage Radical.sh to create our first API.

### Requirements  

* Build a student service that enables us to add, update, and delete student records
* API should be able to list students and should be filter based on date of birth and roll number
* API should be protected by basic authentication

### Build Schema

1. Create a New Project
2. Click on Add Class. Enter 'Student' as the name.
3. Use Add Property for adding "studentId" with data type Integer, "name" and "rollNumber" with data type String, and "dateOfBirth" with data type Date.
4. Click on Audit Fields and choose the necessary audit fields. 

### Enable API

1. Navigate to the API tab.
2. Click on the "Make studentId as key & Enable CRUD" button.
3. You should now be able to see all APIs in the sidebar.

### Explore Code or Download

You have completed the API. Don't believe it? Click on the "Explore" button or the "Download" button in the top navigation.
