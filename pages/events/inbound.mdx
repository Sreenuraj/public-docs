# Inbound Event

What is an inbound event?

If a microservice wants to receive/consume events from another service, an inbound event can be used to consume data.

Steps to create an inbound event:

1. Go to the Events tab.
2. Click on "Add" and select the Inbound Event category. Enter a name and confirm by clicking the plus button.
3. Choose the channel (for more explanation, see [Channels](./channels)).
4. Choose the schema of the inbound event.
5. If a channel contains multiple event types, further filtering is required to process the necessary events.
6. Choose the action on the API. This action will be performed upon consuming the event.

Note: API is a prerequisite for event consumption. You can check how to enable inbound events. You can make the API invisible if you do not want it to be exposed as public.
